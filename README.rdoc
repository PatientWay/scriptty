= Known issues

== Glassfish SocketChannel.keyFor bug

There is a known bug in the JDK that causes SocketChannel.keyFor to behave
erroneously under some versions of Glassfish.  (Glassfish versions 2.1.1 and
3.0 or later are not affected.)  A possible workaround for v2.0 is to add the
following to the appropriate section of your Glassfish config/domain.xml file:

 <jvm-options>-Dcom.sun.enterprise.server.ss.ASQuickStartup=false</jvm-options>
